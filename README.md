# Math 104 Final Project

This project consists of two parts: 1) an application of PageRank to soccer data from La Liga, and 2) an implementation of a SVD-based watermarking algorithm. 

The dataset used for part 1) is described in [this paper](https://rdcu.be/c1qOl) by Pappalardo, et. al. 
Note that to run the code in part 2), you will require MATLAB v2022 with the image-processing toolbox.
